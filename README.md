learning-c
==========

a dump of my c code as I teach it to myself

basic hello world

```c
/* hello.c */
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("\n Hello world!!\n");
  return 0;
}

```


###Notes

#####compile basic c programs we user cc

```
cc hello.c -o hello

```

#####linking programs

more than one will go together to form it

```

cc linkedlist.c test.c -o test

```

#####conditionals

```c

if (cond) {
  
}
```
